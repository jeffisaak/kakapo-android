        <p>
            This screen lists the groups you've set up, and tapping on one of the groups will let

        <p>
            Groups are used to make sharing things with friends easier; when sharing something, you
            can elect to share it with one or more groups, and the item will be shared with all the
            friends in the selected groups.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating groups</h2>
        <p>
            To create a new group, tap the add button and enter a name for the new group.
        </p>

        <h2>Group details</h2>
        <p>
            If you tap on one of the groups, you will be shown a list of friends where you can add
            or remove friends from the group, rename the group, or delete it.
