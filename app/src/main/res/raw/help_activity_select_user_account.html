        <h1>Quick help</h1>
        <p>
            This screen shows a list of the Kakapo accounts you have on your device. From here you
            may sign in, delete accounts, and add new accounts.
        </p>

        <h1>More details</h1>
        <p>
            There are two parts to a Kakapo account. One part is stored on your device, and the
            other part is stored on our servers. This screen lists the accounts that are stored on
            your device.

        <h2>Creating a new account</h2>

            you will be shown a list of three options for adding accounts. To add a new account, tap
            the 'Add new account' button. Enter a name and password for the account and tap 'OK' and

        <h2>Deleting accounts</h2>
        <p>
            You may delete accounts by tapping on the delete button beside the name of the
            account. You will have to enter the password for the account before it may be
            deleted. You may either delete the account only from the device you are using, or you
            may delete the account from our servers as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you delete your account from your device without a backup, you will not be able to
            recover the account. If you delete the account from our servers, the account is
            permanently removed and may not be restored, even if you have a backup.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you delete your account from our servers, all of the things that you have shared
            will be deleted as well, and any responses you make to other people will be removed.
