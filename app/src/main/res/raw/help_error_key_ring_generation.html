        <p>
            When you create a new account, your device generates a pair of keys to use for
            encryption, decryption, and authentication. For some reason, your device failed to
            properly generate a keypair.
        </p>

        <h1>What should I do?</h1>

            It is unlikely that trying again is going to make a difference. If you'd like to
            <a href="mailto:support@kakapo.app">email us</a>
            and tell us what happened, that might help us figure out what went wrong.
