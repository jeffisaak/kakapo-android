        <h1>Why am I seeing this message?</h1>
        <p>
            You are trying to add a friend to Kakapo, but we couldn't find a user with the ID you
            specified. Perhaps the friend you are trying to add removed their Kakapo account, or
            you may be trying to add a friend from the clipboard, but what is on your clipboard
            isn't a Kakapo ID.
        </p>

        <h1>What should I do?</h1>
        <p>
            If you're adding a friend from the clipboard, ensure that what is on the clipboard is a
            friend ID. If that is the case, you can check with the person you're trying to add to
            see if they still have a Kakapo account.
