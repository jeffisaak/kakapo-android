        <h1>Why am I seeing this message?</h1>
        <p>
            The Kakapo server is currently not accessible to your device. This may be because the
            Kakapo server is actually not up at the moment, or it may be because you don't have
            internet access for some reason.
        </p>

        <h1>What should I do?</h1>
        <p>
            Ensure that your device has access to the internet. If it does, then the problem lies
            with the Kakapo server; outages are rare and are usually resolved quickly. Please wait a
            few minutes and try again.
