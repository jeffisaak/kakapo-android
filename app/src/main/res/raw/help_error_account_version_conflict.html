        <h1>Why am I seeing this message?</h1>
        <p>
            The encrypted account information on the server is newer than the account data you are
            attempting to upload to the server.
        </p>

        <h1>How does this happen?</h1>
        <p>
            If you have your Kakapo account on two devices and make changes on both of them (for
            exmaple by adding or renaming a friend), one of them will update the server first. The
            second one to do so will be unable.
        </p>

        <h1>What should I do?</h1>
        <p>
            Exit and restart Kakapo. Account data is synchronized in a few places, most notably on
            app startup, and updated account information will be downloaded and updated on your
            device when you restart the app.
