        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            This screen contains some basic information about your account, such as your ID, colour,
            quota usage, and any queued items that haven't been uploaded to the Kakapo server. It
            allows you to perform operations on your account, such as share your ID with friends,
            and backup or delete your account.
        </p>

        <h1>My ID</h1>
        <p>
            This is how you are identified to the Kakapo server and to people that you share things
            with. It is unique to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may share your ID with your friends by showing a QR code on the screen (which your
            friends may then scan using their device) or by sending it to them via email or a
            messaging service like SMS, WhatsApp, or Signal (we like Signal). Tap the share button
            at the top of your screen, then either of the sharing options in the submenu that is
            displayed to share your ID.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="placeholder" /> -->

        <h1>Colour</h1>
        <p>
            This is a colour that is used on your device to highlight things you share using
            Kakapo. It is not shared with your friends, as they may choose a different colour on
            their device for you. Tap on the colour to select a new one.
        </p>

        <h1>Queued items</h1>
        <p>
            If you have created new items that did not get successfully uploaded to the Kakapo
            server, they wil be listed on this screen. You can edit them by tapping on them, or
            delete or resubmit them by long-pressing on them and selecting the appropriate option
            from the menu that appears.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="placeholder" /> -->

        <h1>My quota</h1>
        <p>
            When you share stuff with Kakapo, it is stored on the Kakapo server in encrypted form.
            Everything you share takes up a certain amount of disk space on our servers, and you are
            allocated a maximum. This will show you how much disk space you are using on the server
            and what your maximum is.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you reach your
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_info_kakapo_quota">quota</a>, you will not
            be able to share anything unless you first delete
            something. Deleting stuff you've shared removes it from the Kakapo server and reduces
            the amount of disk space you use.
        </p>

        <h1>Deleting your account</h1>
        <p>
            You may delete your account just from your device or from your device and from our
            servers. Deleting your account from your device may be reversed by restoring your
            account from a backup (if you have one). Deleting your account from our servers is
            irreversible. When you delete your account from our servers all of the things you have
            shared will be deleted as well.
        </p>
        <p>To delete your account, tap the delete button (the trashcan) at the top of your screen,
            then select whether you'd like to delete the account from just your device or also our
            servers from the menu that appears. You will be asked to enter your password and must do
            so successfully before your account is deleted.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="placeholder" /> -->

        <h1>Renaming your account</h1>
        <p>
            Your account name is only used on your device, and can be anything you like. It is not
            shared with anyone; your friends will assign a name to you on their device. Tap the
            rename account button at the top of the screen and enter a new name to rename your
            account.
        </p>

        <h1>Sharing your account to another device</h1>
        <p>
            The easiest way to copy your account to another device is to share it. Please see the
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_info_share_account">share accounts help</a>
            for details.
        </p>

        <h1>Backing up your account</h1>
        <p>
            Backing up your account is important and is another way to share your account to another
            device. You'll find detailed instructions on the
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_info_backup">backup help page</a>.
        </p>

            out button.
