        <h1>Why am I seeing this message?</h1>
        <p>
            The only reason you're seeing this error message is if you have modified the source code
            of the Kakapo app and are trying to break things by sending us a very large byte array
            as a public key for a new account.
        </p>

        <h1>What should I do?</h1>
        <p>
            Stop it.
        </p>
