        <p>
            To restore your backed up account, locate the backup file that you saved when you backed
            up your account and open it on your device. When asked what app to open it with, select
            'Restore Kakapo Account'.
        </p>

        <h1>More details</h1>
        <p>
            To restore an account, you must first have made a backup of your account. When you
            create a backup, Kakapo allows you to share it using the sharing capabilities of your
            device. Read more about
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_info_backup">backing up your
                account</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wherever you saved your account backup, go find it. If you emailed
            it to yourself, open your email app and locate the email. If you saved it on your
            device, find the file with a file explorer app (we like Amaze). Or if you saved it to
            the cloud, locate the file with your cloud app, such as Google Drive or Nextcloud.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you've located the file, open or share it. Your device
            will show you a list of ways that you can open/share the file. One of them should be
            'Restore Kakapo Account'. Select that, and Kakapo will open the backup file and ask you
            for the password that you used to encrypt the backup. This is not the same password as
            your account password, although there is nothing stopping you from using the same
            password for your account and for encrypting your backups.

            Once you've entered the correct password, you'll be shown a summary of the account. If
            you decide to proceed with the restore, tap the checkbox at the top of the screen and
            the account will be restored to your device. You can then log in to the account and use
            it normally.
