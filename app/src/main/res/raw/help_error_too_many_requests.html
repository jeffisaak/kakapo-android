        <h1>Why am I seeing this message?</h1>
        <p>
            This message appears when you are making many requests to the Kakapo server in a very
            short amount of time. In order to try and limit abuse of our server, we have put limits
            to the number of requests that can be made within a certain time period, and apparently
            you have exceeded those limits.
        </p>

        <h1>What should I do?</h1>
        <p>
            Wait a little while and try again.
        </p>

        <h1>More information</h1>
        <p>
            Currently the only things that are throttled are account creation and new item creation.
            Both are limited to one per minute. Account creation is limited based on your IP
            address, and new posts are limited on a user basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additional limits may be put in place as they become necessary.
        </p>
