        <title>Help: How does Kakapo work?</title>
    </head>
    <body>

        <h1>The Short Answer</h1>
        <p>
            Kakapo works by storing your social graph on your device and by using end-to-end
            encryption. This means that Kakapo encrypts things you share on your device before
            sending it to our servers, and decrypts things your friends share on your device after
            they are downloaded from our servers. This all means that we don't know who you are,
            we don't know who your friends are, and we don't know what you're sharing.
        </p>

        <h1>The Long Answer</h1>

        <p>
            Kakapo is built on top of something called public key cryptography. This is a
            cryptographic system that uses a pair of keys: the public key may be distributed and the
            private key is known only to the owner. This system enables authentication (so that
            your friends can verify that you are who you say you are) and encryption (so that only
            you can decrypt messages intended for you).
        </p>

        <p>
            It's actually slightly more complicated than that; there's a key exchange and some other
            technical cryptographic stuff, and if you're interested in that, please visit the
            <a href="https://github.com/jeffisaak/kakapo">Kakapo Github</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you create a Kakapo account, your device generates a public-secret keypair. The
            public key is sent to us so that your friends can encrypt messages for you and the
            secret key is stored on your device. We also generate a unique ID for you that
            identifies you on the Kakapo network. It looks something like this:
            046b6c7f-0b8a-43b9-b35d-6489e6daee91.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you want to connect with someone on Kakapo, you will need to share your ID with
            them. You can do this via email, instant messaging, or your friend can scan a QR code
            from your device. If you want them to be able to share stuff with you, you should share
            your ID with them as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you share stuff with your friends using Kakapo, it is encrypted on your device
            using your friends' public keys before it is sent to our servers. Then, when your
            friends download it, it is decrypted on their device using their private keys. And
            because only your friends have access to their own private keys, they are the only ones
            that can decrypt and see what you share with them.
        </p>

        <p>
            The upshot of all this is that the Kakapo service is really just a storage service. All
            the really interesting stuff happens on your device. And the reason we do it this way is
            to
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_info_your_privacy">preserve your privacy</a>.
            We don't want to know who you are or who your friends are or what you're sharing.
            Unfortunately, this means it's a little less user-friendly than it could be, but we
            think it's worth the sacrifice.
