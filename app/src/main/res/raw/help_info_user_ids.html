        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Every Kakapo account is identified only by a unique ID. You may assign your own account
            a name and give your friends names, but those names stay on your device. The unique ID
            is shared with the Kakapo server.
        </p>

        <h1>What does it look like?</h1>
        <p>Kakapo IDs are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">
            universally unique identifiers (wikipedia.org)</a>. They look something like this:
            046b6c7f-0b8a-43b9-b35d-6489e6daee91.
        </p>

        <h1>Why should I care?</h1>
        <p>
            Since each user is only identified by their ID, this ID becomes the way that you connect
            with your friends. In order to add a friend in Kakapo, you will need their ID, and vice
            versa.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've tried to make
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_info_connecting_with_friends">adding friends</a>
            and sharing user IDs easy.
        </p>

        <h1>Do I need to keep my ID private?</h1>
        <p>
            You can if you choose to, but you should know that your friends that have your ID can
            also choose to share it, so it would be wise for you to assume that your ID is public.
            If someone has your ID, they can share things with you. If someone is sharing things
            with you that you don't want to see, you can ignore them and filter their posts out of
            your news feed.
