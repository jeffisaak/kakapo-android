        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            This screen contains your news feed; all of the things that you share and all of the
            things that are shared with you will be listed here. From this screen you can filter
            your news feed, read items and create and upload new items to share with your friends.
        </p>

        <h1>Refreshing the list</h1>
        <p>
            When new things are shared with you they are not automatically downloaded; in order to
            see the latest items, scroll to the top of the list and then swipe down to refresh the
            list.
        </p>

        <h1>Filtering the list</h1>
        <p>
            You can filter the list to include your items, your friends items, and strangers items
            (a stranger is someone that has you as a friend but you don't have them as a friend).
            You can also show or hide deleted items and ignored items.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="placeholder" /> -->

        <h1>Item details</h1>
        <p>
            To view an item and to read any responses that other friends may have shared to it, tap
            on it in the list. If the item has an attached photo, you may tap on the thumbnail to
            view a full-size image.
        </p>

        <h1>Long-press</h1>
        <p>
            You can long-press on an item to perform operations on the item. If you long-press, a
            menu will appear that allows you to delete an item, add the author of an item as a
            friend, and ignore both the author and the individual item.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="placeholder" /> -->

        <h2>
            Turning a stranger into a friend
        </h2>
        <p>
            It is possible for someone to have you as a friend when you don't have them as a friend.
            In Kakapo, these people are called strangers. You can turn a stranger into a friend by
            finding something that they have shared and adding them as a friend. To do this from the
            news feed, long-press on an item and select 'Add friend' from the popup menu that
            appears. Give the friend a name, and you're set.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Ignoring people and items
        </h2>
        <p>
            You can ignore both individual items and all items by specific people. If you have
            ignored someone, nothing they share will be shown in your newsfeed unless you choose to
            view ignored items using the filter. If you change your mind about ignoring someone or
            something, you can long-press on the item after showing it using the filter and unignore
            either the author or item.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="placeholder" /> -->

        <h1>Creating new items</h1>
        <p>
            To share a new item with your friends, tap on the add button at the bottom of the screen
            and
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_activity_share_item">a new screen</a>
            will open allowing you to set a title and message, share a web site URL, and upload
            images.
        </p>

        <h1>Failed shares</h1>
        <p>
            If you create a new item and the upload fails, it will be displayed in the news feed
            with a note indicating failure. You may tap on it and see the detailed reason it failed
            and have options to modify the item and resend it.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="placeholder" /> -->

        <p>
            To sign out of your account and return to the sign in/sign up screen, tap the sign
            out button.
