        <p>
            When you create a new account, your device generates a pair of keys to use for
            encryption, decryption, and authentication. It then attempts to save the keypair so that
            it can be retrieved and used in the future. For some reason, your device failed to
            properly save the new keypair.
        </p>

            It is unlikely that trying again is going to make a difference. If you'd like to
            <a href="mailto:support@kakapo.app">email us</a>
            and tell us what happened, that might help us figure out what went wrong.
