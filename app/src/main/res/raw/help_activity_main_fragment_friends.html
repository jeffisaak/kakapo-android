        <h1>Friends</h1>
        <p>
            This screen lists your friends. If you tap on one of your friends you can see some
            details regarding the friend and modify the groups that they are members of. You can
            also add friends from this screen.
        </p>

        <h2>Adding friends</h2>
        <p>
            To add a friend to Kakapo, tap the add button, then tap either the 'Add friend
            from QR code' button (if you want to scan a friend's ID with your camera) the 'Add
            friend from clipboard' button (if you've copied your friends ID to the clipboard), or
            the 'Add friend manually' button (if you want to type your friends ID in manually).
        </p>
        <img src="placeholder" />
        <p>
            You will then be prompted to name your friend. This can be whatever you choose, and
            needn't be your friends real name. It is only present on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Friend details</h2>
        <p>
            If you tap on one of your friends, you will be shown some details about the friend,
            including their ID, their colour, and which groups they are members of. From the friend
            details you can change their colour, modify the groups that they are members of, share
            the friend's ID, or rename or delete the friend.
