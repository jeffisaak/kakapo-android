        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Privacy is important. We think it's so important that we are willing to sacrifice some
            convenience to help preserve privacy. In fact, we think it's so important that we tried
            to design Kakapo so that we are unable to profit by violating your privacy. In Kakapo,
            privacy is The Most Important Thing.

        <h1>Why does it matter?</h1>
        <p>
            Glenn Greenwald gave an excellent TED talk called
            <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters">Why Privacy
                Matters (ted.com)</a>. He explains things much better than we can in this space.

        <h1>How does Kakapo protect my privacy?</h1>
        <p>
            We protect your privacy by storing as little information about you as possible. The
            information we store and a bit about how we use that information is explained in our
            <a href="https://kakapo.app/privacy.html">privacy policy
                (kakapo.app)</a>.
        </p>

        <h1>So how do you make money?</h1>
        <p>
            Well, we don't. That's not the point.
