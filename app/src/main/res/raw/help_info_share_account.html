        <h1>Share account</h1>
        <p>
            One easy way to copy your account onto another device is by sharing it from the first
            device and adding it to the second device. To start the process, first sign in to your
            Kakapo account on the first device, navigate to the 'Me' screen, select the 'Share'
            action at the top of the screen, and select 'Share my account to another device'. A QR
            code will be shown on the screen.

        <p>
            Then, using the second device, ensure you are at the 'Sign in/sign up' screen, tap
            the add button near the bottom of the screen, then select 'Add account from another
            device' and scan the QR code currently shown on the first device. The account will be
            added to the list of accounts and you may use it to sign in.
