        <h1>Share account</h1>
        <p>
            There are two ways to share your account to another device: By scanning a QR code or
            by copying and pasting a long text string. Scanning the QR code is easier and is
            recommended for everyone, but if the device you are adding the account to doesn't
            have a camera, you may have to copy and paste the backup string instead.
        </p>

        <h2>A note on encryption</h2>
        <p>
            When your account details are stored on the Kakapo server, they are encrypted using
            your account password. We are unable to decrypt your account details, even if we wanted
            to.
        </p>

        <h2>Sharing with QR codes</h2>
        <p>
            To share your account to another device using QR codes, first sign in to your Kakapo
            account on the first device, navigate to the 'Me' screen, select the 'Share' action at
            the top of the screen, and select 'Share my account as QR Code'. A QR code will
            be shown on the screen.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="placeholder" /> -->
        <p>
            Then, using the second device, ensure you are at the 'Sign in/sign up' screen, tap
            the add button near the bottom of the screen, then select 'Add account from QR code'
            and scan the QR code currently shown on the first device. You will be prompted to
            enter the account password. Upon successfully entering the password, the account will be
            added to the list of accounts and you may use it to sign in.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="placeholder" /> -->

        <h2>Sharing with text</h2>
        <p>
            The process is very similar to sharing with QR codes, except when sharing the account,
            select 'Share my account as text'. You will then have to get the text to whatever
            device you want to add the account to, whether by instant messaging, email, or what
            you.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other device, at the 'Sign in/sign up' screen, select 'Add account from
            clipboard' and then enter your account password.
