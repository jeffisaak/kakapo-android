        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Connecting with friends on Kakapo involves exchanging IDs. This can happen through
            email, instant messaging, scanning a QR code, or if you're feeling particularly
            sadistic, typing it out manually.
        </p>

        <h1>Sharing your ID with others</h1>
        <p>
            To share your ID with others, navigate to the "Me" screen and tap the share button. You
            can share your ID through showing a QR code on the screen, or by sending your ID via an
            app you have installed on your phone (such as email or an instant messaging app).
        </p>

        <h1>Adding your friends</h1>
        <p>
            To add a friend to Kakapo, navigate to the "Friends" screen and tap the add button, then
            tap the "Add friend from QR code" button (if you want to scan a friend's ID with
            your camera), the "Add friend from clipboard" button (if you've copied your friends ID
            to the clipboard), or the "Add friend manually" button if you want to type out your
            friends ID.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will then be prompted to name your friend. This can be whatever you choose, and
            needn't be your friends real name. It is only present on your device.
        </p>

        <h1>Strangers</h1>
        <p>
            It is possible for someone to share things with you if they have your ID and you do not
            have theirs. The items in your news feed will be marked as being from someone you do not
            have in your friends list, and instead of their name you will see their ID. You can add
            this person as a friend by tapping the add friend button on the item.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you'd rather not see news items from strangers, you may use the news filter to hide
            items from strangers.
