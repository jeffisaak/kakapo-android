            To submit a new item, select one or more friends and/or groups to share the item with,
            enter a title, and one or more of a URL, attachment, and message, then tap the send
            button at the top of the screen.
        </p>

        <h1>Selecting friends and groups</h1>
        <p>
            To select friends and/or groups to share with, start typing the friend/group name in the
            'Share with' text field. Once you type two characters, the friends and groups that
            match will be shown in a list and you can select one. To add another friend or group,
            start typing the next friend or group name.
