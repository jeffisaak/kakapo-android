        <h1>Kakapo accounts</h1>
        <p>
            There are two parts to your Kakapo account. One part is stored on your device and the
            other part is stored on our servers, and in order for you to use Kakapo, both parts need
            to be available.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that if you have an account and want to use that account on another device,
            you will need to either
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_info_share_account">share the account</a>
            to the second device or
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_info_backup">backup the account</a>
            and then
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_info_restore">restore it</a>
            on the new device. If you want to reinstall Kakapo, you need to backup your account
            before you do and then restore it afterwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to understand that once shared or restored onto a new device, the
            accounts on the two devices do not stay synchronized. Any changes that you make to your
            list of friends and groups on one device will not be reflected on your other device(s).
        </p>
        <h1>A warning</h1>
        <p>
            If you do not have a backup of your account and you must reinstall Kakapo for any
            reason, you will lose access to your account, and there is nothing we can do about it.
