        <h1>Kakapo accounts</h1>

        <p>
            Your Kakapo account data is stored on your device, and encrypted and backed up to the
            Kakapo servers. Any time you make changes to your Kakapo account (such as adding friends
            or groups), your account data is encrypted and uploaded to the Kakapo server so that it
            can be synchronized to any other devices that you want to use your Kakapo account on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, when you launch Kakapo, it checks to see if the account data has been updated by
            one of your other devices, and synchronizes the account on your device with the
            updated account info on the server.
        </p>
        <p>
            When this happens, your account data is encrypted on your device using your password
            before it is uploaded to the Kakapo server. When account data is uploaded, it is
            decrypted on your device. This means that your devices can stay in sync while we
            continue to protect your privacy.
        </p>

        <h2>Syncing and backups</h2>
        <p>
            Please read the help pages on
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_info_share_account">syncing your account</a>
            to another device and
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_info_backup">backing up your account</a>.
        </p>

        <h1>A warning</h1>
        <p>
            If you do not have a backup of your account and you must reinstall Kakapo for any
            reason, you will lose access to your account, and there is nothing we can do about it.
        </p>
