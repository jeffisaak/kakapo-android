        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            When you share stuff with Kakapo, it is stored on the Kakapo server in encrypted form.
            Everything you share takes up a certain amount of disk space on our servers, and you are
            allocated a maximum. This is your quota.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you reach your quota, you will not be able to share anything unless you first delete
            something. Deleting stuff you've shared removes it from the Kakapo server and reduces
            the amount of disk space you use.
        </p>

        <h1>How much can I share?</h1>
        <p>
            The quota is currently set to 50MB while we launch Kakapo and try to gauge interest in
            the project. If you don't share any images, that should last you a very long time. If
            you do, you'll be able to share about 7 to 10 photos from your smartphone before your
            quota is exhausted.
        </p>

        <h1>How can I see my quota and usage?</h1>
        <p>
            Your quota and usage is displayed on the "Me" screen.
