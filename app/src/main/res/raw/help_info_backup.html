        <h1>Backups</h1>
        <p>
            Backing up your account is important if you want to ensure that you won't lose access to
            it if you lose your phone or reinstall the Kakapo app.
        </p>
        <p>
            The information necessary to restore your account is contained in a text string that
            contains your unique user ID, the key that you use to access the Kakapo server, and
            something called a salt that is combined with your password to encrypt your account
            data. In addition to your password, these three things are all that is needed to
            back up your account.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may either back up this information as text or as a QR code image.
        </p>

        <h2>Backing up as a QR Code</h2>
        <p>
            To back up your account to another device using a QR code, navigate to the 'Me' screen,
            select the 'Share' action at the top of the screen, and select 'Share my account as QR
            Code'. A QR code will be shown on the screen. You may then take a screenshot to save
            the QR code.
        </p>

        <h2>Backing up as text</h2>
        <p>
            To back up your account as text, navigate to the 'Me' screen, select the 'Share' action
            at the top of the screen, and select 'Share my account as text'. Then, from the list of
            apps that appears, select how you'd like to save the backup text. You can email it to
            yourself, instant message yourself, or save it as a file on your device, depending on
            the apps you have installed.
