        <title>Help: Backing up your account</title>
    </head>
    <body>

        <h1>Backups</h1>
        <p>
            Backing up your account is important if you want to ensure that you won't lose access to
            it if you lose your phone or reinstall the Kakapo app.
        </p>
        <p>
            To back up your account, navigate to the "me" screen and tap the backup button at the top
            of the screen. After entering a password to protect the backup, the backup file will be
            created, encrypted, and shared. When prompted, select how you would like to share your
            backup. You could email it to yourself, save it to your device, or upload it to your
            cloud provider, depending on the apps that you have installed.
        </p>

        <h2>What should I do with the backup?</h2>
        <p>
            If you're backing up your account to restore it on another device, you may now
            <a href="com.aptasystems.kakapo://help/help_info_restore">restore your
                account</a>
            on the other device.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you just want to have a backup in case you lose your device, you're done.
        </p>

        <h2>What gets backed up?</h2>
        <p>
            The backup includes your secret and public keys (which identify and secure your
            account), and your friends and groups lists. It does not include anything you've shared
            that hasn't yet been uploaded to the Kakapo servers.
        </p>

        <h2>Is my backup safe?</h2>
        <p>
            Your backup is protected by your password and is encrypted using
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES
                (wikipedia.org)</a>
            with a 256-bit key. If you choose a good password and don't publish your backup on the
            internet, it should be fairly safe. Even if someone gains access to your backup and uses
            it to successfully restore your account on their device, they will still need your
            Kakapo password to access your account.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I pick a good password?</h2>
        <p>
            We recommend two things: use a password manager (we like the KeePass family of tools for
            various platforms) and use Diceware passwords. We recommend the free, open-source
            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aptasystems.dicewarepasswordgenerator">
                Diceware Password Generator (play.google.com)</a>, developed and published by us.
